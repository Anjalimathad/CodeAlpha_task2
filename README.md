This project focuses on analyzing the unemployment rate in India, with a special emphasis on the impact of Covid-19 on the job market. Using real-world unemployment datasets, the analysis uncovers state-wise, rural vs. urban, and seasonal unemployment patterns.

By cleaning and exploring the dataset, we aim to identify trends and insights that can guide policymakers, researchers, and economists in understanding employment challenges and creating effective strategies.
